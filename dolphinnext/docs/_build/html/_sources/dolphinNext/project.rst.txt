Creating Projects and Adding Pipelines
======================================

Projects are platforms to categorize all of your runs and files. To run a pipeline, it is required to add selected pipelines into your project. There are two ways to create a new project and add pipelines to it:

    * A. First, click the "Projects" button in the top of the screen. In this new page, new projects can be inserted by clicking "Create a Project" button. After saving the name of the project, it will be added to your projects table as shown in the figure below:

	   :align: center

    .. note::
        You can always edit or remove your projects by clicking "edit" or "remove" button on the project table.

    Now you are able to enter the "project page" by clicking the "name of the project" at the projects table. You will notice three sections in the project page:
        * **Description:** Box to keep project related information.
        * **Project Runs:** Table to add your pipelines as a run by clicking "Add Pipeline to Run" button. You may enter your run page by clicking "name of the run".
